                    <p class="page3__suptitle">The final formation of the samurai as a special
                        privileged class took place, according to most researchers,
                        during the reign of the House of Minamotoin the Land of the Rising Sun
                        (this is the period from 1192 to 1333). Minamoto's accession was preceded
                        by a civil war between the feudal clans. The very course of this
                        war created the preconditions for the emergence of the shogunate -
                        a form of government with a shogun (that is, a military leader)
                        at its head.</p>
                    <p class="page3__suptitle">It is believed that the "golden age" of samurai
                        was the period from the first shogun to the Onin civil war (1467-1477).
                        On the one hand, it was a fairly peaceful period, on the other,
                        the number of samurai was relatively small, which allowed them
                        to have a good income.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="page3__paragraph">
                    <p class="page3__suptitle">With the coming to power of the Tokugawa house,
                        the samurai class increased significantly - almost every fifth Japanese
                        became a samurai.
                        Since internal feudal wars are a thing of the past,
                        the military units of the samurai at this time were used
                        mainly to suppress peasant uprisings.</p>
                    <p class="page3__suptitle">There is a misconception that all samurai
                        were wealthy enough people. But this is not the case.
                        Already under the Tokugawa of shogunate, there were poor
                        samurai who did not live much better than ordinary peasants.
                        And in order to feed their families, someâ€¨of them still
                        had to cultivate the land.</p>

              <div class="page5__description">
                <p class="page5__suptitle">The beginning of the collapse of the samurai estate
                   is due to the fact that daimyo no longer need large personal detachments
                   of warriors, as it was during the period of feudal fragmentation.
                   As a result, many samurai were left out of work, turned into ronin
                   (samurai without a master) or ninja - secret assassins-mercenaries.</p>
                <p class="page5__suptitle">After the Meiji bourgeois revolution of 1867-1868,
                   the samurai, like other feudal estates, were officially abolished,
                   but for some time they retained their privileged position.
                   Those samurai who, even under the Tokugawa, actually owned the land,
                   after the agrarian reforms of 1872-1873, legally secured their rights to it.
                   In addition, the ranks of officials, army and navy officers, etc.,
                   were replenished with former samurai.</p>
                <p class="page5__suptitle">And in 1876, the famous "Decree on the Prohibition of Swords"
                   was issuedin Japan. It directly prohibited the wearing of traditional edged weapons,
                   and this ultimately "finished off" the samurai. Over time, they have become just a part
                   of history, and their traditions have become an element of the unique Japanese flavor.</p>

                  <div class="page6__paragraph">
                      <p class="page6__suptitle">What medieval samurai looked like is reliably
                          known from many sources. For many centuries, their appearance has hardly
                          changed. Most often, samurai wore wide trousers, resembling a skirt in cut,
                          with a bun of hair on their head, called motodori. For this hairstyle,
                          the forehead was shaved bald, and the remaining hair was braided into
                          a knot and secured at the crown.</p>
                  </div>
                    <p class="page6__suptitle">With regard to weapons, over the course
                        of a long history, samurai have used different types of weapons.
                        Initially, the main weapon was a thin short sword called a chokuto.
                        Then the samurai switched to curved swords, which eventually transformed
                        into the katanas known all over the world today. In the Bushido code,
                        it was said that the soul of a samurai is contained in his katana.
                        And it is not surprising that this sword was considered the most
                        important attribute of a warrior. </p>
                    <p class="page6__suptitle">In addition to swords, bows were also used by samurai
                        , since with the development of military affairs, personal courage, the
                        ability to fight the enemy in close combat, began to matter much less.
                        And when gunpowder appeared in the 16th century, bows gave way to firearms
                        and cannons. For example, popular during the Edo period were the flintlock
                        rifles called tanegashima.</p>
                    <p class="page6__suptitle">An integral part of the armor was Kabuto's helmet.
                        Its cup-shaped part was made of metal plates, connected with rivets.
                        An interesting feature of this helmet is the presence of a comforter
                        (just like Darth Vader from "Star Wars"). It protected the wearer's neck
                        from possible blows from swords and arrows. Together with helmets,
                        samurai sometimes wore gloomy Mengu masks - to intimidate the enemy.</p>
